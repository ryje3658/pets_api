# **API Use Guide**

### [Base Route](jensenry.pythonanywhere.com/)
Add one of below routes to base url to make a call. Make sure there is a  trailing ‘/’ at the end (Ex.  jensenry.pythonanywhere.com/pets/)

### admin/
-Admin page, can log in as a superuser and view or alter any entries in the database
-This isn’t actually an API route callable by the frontend- it just provides a UI to see the database

### api/ [GET]
Isn’t actually an api call you’d use. But while debugging it does have a nice UI to click around the API and follow hyperlinks to endpoints.
